House Price Prediction with Linear Regression
This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts house prices using linear regression. The model is trained on a dataset of house sales, and it can be used to estimate the price of a new house based on its features.
This is a basic example and may not be suitable for real-world house price prediction due to the complex nature of the housing market.
